//About//
* This is a Java Snap Game which utilises the concepts of OOP to create a working snap game in the console.
* It takes input from the user asking whether they want to play single or two-player and you click enter to essentially deal a card
* It takes input from the user such as the users name and tells them that they are they allocated to be player 1 or 2
* The user which has the snap card will be the winner temporarily but the opposing winner will have the opportunity to reclaim the win
  by typing snap
* Based on whether the user has an input, doesn't have an input or doesn't haven input within a specific timeframe a message will be
  displayed
